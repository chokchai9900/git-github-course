# Git & GitHub Course (Minimal Site)

This is a **minimal, distraction-free** Markdown website for a Git & GitHub course (Beginner → Advanced).

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo and push this project.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Source: **Deploy from a branch** → Branch: `main` (or your default), Folder: `/docs` → **Save**.
4. Wait for the build; the site appears at your Pages URL.

> We use the built-in **Minimal** theme with a tiny custom CSS.
